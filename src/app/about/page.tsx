        My interest in moving around the world has motivated me to work on this project. The current global map shows
        the country name but that does not provide any further information by only pinpointing the country in the map. I
        could not find any interactive quiz map game, therefore I decided to develop such application. Such project can
        grow in multiple directions with several different great features, in the case of Meet the countries the main
        idea was to apply several latest web technologies that combined can form a well-structured production
